# Undestanding Corner Cases and Edge Cases

Corner cases and edge cases are scenarios that test the boundries and limitations of your code. They often involve extreme or unexpected inputs that can lead to unexpected or incorrect behavior.

## Common types of corner cases and edges caes in Python:

1. Empty inputs: empty strings, lists, dictionaries, or other data structures.
2. Null or None values: Handling cases where variables migt be null or None.
3. Maximum and minimum values: Testing with the largest and smalles possible values for numeric data types.
4. Special characters: Handling characters like newlines, tabs, or control characters.
5. Data types: Ensuring your code can handle different data types correctley (e.g., integers, floats, strings).
6. Boundary conditions: Testing values at the boundaries of expected ranges (e.g., minimum and maximum age limits).
7. Error handling: Handling errors or exceptions that might occur during execution.

Example:

Let's consider a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers:

[example](example.py)

## Strategies for Practicing Corner Cases and Edge Cases

1. Write comprehensive test caes: Create a variety of test cases
2. Use a testing framework: Python has excellent testing frameworks like unitests and pytest that can help you write and run tests efficiently.

### Pytest and unittest

3. Code reviews: Have other developers review your code to identify potential corner cases that you might have missed.
4. Explore different input values: Experiment with various input values to see how your code behaves under different conditions.

## Additional Tips

1. Think creatively: Consider unusual scenarios that might not be immediately obvious.
2. Use debugging tools: Utilize debuggers to step through your code and inspect values at different points.
3. Lear from experience: Analyze past bugs and errors to identify common patterns and improve your coding practices.

By practicing with corner cases and edge cases, you can significantly improve the robustness and reliability of your Python code.
